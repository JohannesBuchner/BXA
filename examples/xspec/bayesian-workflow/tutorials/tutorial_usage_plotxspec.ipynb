    "## Basic PyXspec usage & additional plotting\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is aimed at illustrating the _basic_ usage of PyXspec, as well as a few supporting methods related to plotting. The supporting methods are part of the [PlotXspec class available for download here](https://github.com/JohannesBuchner/BXA/tree/master/examples/xspec/bayesian-workflow). The notebook will cover how to load spectra, define a model, fit it to the data, and plot the results. PyXspec makes all Xspec functionality accessible through Python, so has a much broader range of options than covered here. For further details on PyXspec usage, please see the [documentation](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/xanadu/xspec/python/html/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we will assume a basic familiarity with both Python and Xspec usage. Users will need to have a working HEASOFT installation, as well as a working Python3 installation. The examples focus on the 'out-of-the-box' usage of the PlotXSpec public methods. Some users may find it more helpful to use these methods as a template for their own plotting functions; the PlotXspec class includes several private methods that could also be of use as a guide (such as the ```_get_xspec_data()``` method).\n",
    "\n",
    "_Please note_: this notebook relates to PyXspec only. For examples of using BXA and the PlotBXA class, please see the notebook [_tutorial_usage_plotbxa_](https://johannesbuchner.github.io/BXA/tutorial_usage_plotbxa.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### The notebook is structured as follows:\n",
    "1) Basic loading and plotting data using PyXspec\n",
    "2) Further plotting examples\n",
    "3) A slightly more complicated example (multiple spectra & simultaneous fitting)\n",
