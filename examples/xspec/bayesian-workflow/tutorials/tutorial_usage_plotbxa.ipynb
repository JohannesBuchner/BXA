    "This notebook aims to illustrate additional plotting features for BXA fitting results, as implemented in the PlotBXA class. The methods of this class will be demonstrated in a basic example of BXA fitting. For details on BXA usage and the underlying fitting algorithm please see refer to Johannes Buchner's detailed [BXA documentation](https://johannesbuchner.github.io/BXA/index.html) and [UltraNest documentation](https://johannesbuchner.github.io/UltraNest/readme.html), which also contain several useful examples. \n",

    "An overview of tutorials on BXA usage can be found [here](https://johannesbuchner.github.io/BXA/tutorials.html). The methods in PlotBXA are extensions of the built-in methods of UltraNest and BXA. Furthermore, they are strongly based on the [excellent tutorial](https://peterboorman.com/tutorial_bxa) by Peter Boorman. As for the classes defined in PlotXspec, some users may find it more helpful to use these methods as a template for their own plotting.\n",

The method ```plot_qq``` is in addition to the built-in ```bxa.xspec.qq``` method. ```plot_qq_difference``` presents the difference of the normalised cumulative distribution functions (data - model) plotted against energy; this can be of use in identifying where model and data diverge. \n",

If the range in model uncertainties (in yellow/orange) lies within the range set by the uncertainties of the data (in grey), this is an indication the model suits the data well.

    "One of the strengths of Bayesian analysis is that it provides a statistical method for comparing the relative strengths of models, based on the Bayesian 'evidence' (the likelihood marginalised over the free parameters). Fitting multiple models to the data and comparing the results provides a useful way of analysing a dataset. PlotBXA's methods are set up with this use in mind.\n",

As we saw in the results of our simple fit in the previous section, there are considerable residuals in this first fit. We will therefore test several models and compare the results using a Bayesian framework. We can use the visualisations of the fits, QQ plots, and the posterior predictive checks to visualise the relative quality of the fits, including comparisons with simulated data. A section below provides some more detail on Bayesian evidence.\n",

    "When creating these for a fit with multiple data groups in XSpec, the order of the priors in the solver is important. In particular, PlotBXA methods require the priors to be presented in the same order as the loaded spectra: first all priors associated with the parameters that are free in data group 1 (i.e. the first spectrum), then all the priors associated with data group 2 (the second spectrum), etc.\n",

For 'mod1' the first 2 priors relate to the pn spectrum (data group 1), the 3rd prior is for the constant scaling factor for the MOS1 spectrum (data group 2), and the 4th prior is the scaling factor for the MOS2 spectrum (data group 3). This order must be used for PlotBXA methods to correctly access the model components."
